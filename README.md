# Analyzing & Visualizing Tech Stocks


In this project I will analyze and visualize the top 5 highest valued technology stocks, as of the end of the first half of 2019:
* Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
* Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
* Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
* Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)
* Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Using Pandas, Pandas-Datarader, and Matplotlib, I will take a visual look into the similarities and differences between these stocks during the six month period from January through June 2019. I will perform the following:
1. Visualize the stock prices using matplotlib
2. Calculate and visualize the daily simple rate of return 
3. Calculate and visualize the mean rates of return
4. Calculate and visualize the variances of the returns
5. Calculate and visualize the standard deviations of the returns
